A common place to identify and server definition of groups/clusters for pools in Cardano Ecosystem.
The definition of group/cluster is usually very losely held, allowing many to leverage the wordings. Essentially a pool that may be sharing Core/Relays, Marketing, provisioning pool as a part of a service - are all eligible to be reported to `addendum.json` file on this repository.

The repo in itself could also further be helpful for disputes resolutions/sharing metadata-related information or rules across various tools.

Anyone is free to add commits, we'd expect atleast 3 of the existing collaborators to be on same page before it is merged

In order to add a known pool cluster that's not already in the list, you can directly use [this link](https://github.com/cardano-community/pool_groups/edit/main/descrepancy.json).
